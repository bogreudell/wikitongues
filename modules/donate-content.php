7,000 languages are spoken or signed today, but 3,000 languages could vanish this century as the communities that speak them collapse. In a generation, centuries of cultural, historical, and ecological knowledge will be erased as the last speakers of endangered languages die. But language extinction is not inevitable.

With the right resources, anyone can learn the language of their ancestors, teach the next generation, and keep their culture alive. Wikitongues gives annual grants and training to the leaders of new mother-tongue projects.
